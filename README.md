# CustomGPT
Custom GPT that hits OpenAI api and returns data from the informatiojn that the user feeds the program

Important file heirarchy:
-The "Knowledgebase" folder stores .txt files that information is searched from

Important code Syntax:
-There are some things in this code that you are going to have to change.
1.) Dirtectory to the knowledgebase folder
2.) Directory where to store the created .json file
4.) Your own personal Open AI API Key





In this project, an indexed.json file is created with all of the information that is processed from the knowledge base. As of right now, the knowledge base is entirely comprised of .txt files

Press the Esc button on your keyboard to end the never ending asking of questions lol.

Happy Hacking!
